# CogniCoreAI-

## Next.js Application

CogniCoreAI is built using the Next.js framework, which provides server-side rendering, routing capabilities, and built-in mobile optimizations. This ensures optimal performance and user experience across devices.

Features:
- Server-side rendering (SSR): Utilize Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities to enhance the performance of CogniCoreAI on both web and mobile platforms. SSR enables faster loading times and improves the overall user experience by pre-rendering pages on the server.
- Responsive design: Implement responsive design techniques to ensure that CogniCoreAI adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions. This will enable optimal viewing and interaction experiences on both web and mobile devices.
- Mobile optimizations: Leverage Next.js's built-in mobile optimizations to deliver a smooth and efficient experience on mobile devices. These optimizations include performance enhancements, such as code splitting and lazy loading, that improve load times and minimize resource usage on mobile devices.
